  <h2>Tum Jo Aaye Zindagi Mei, Baat Ban Gyi</h2>
  <p>Its been an year of us. I have so much to say to you but at the same time I have nothing to say. You already know everything. There is nothing new that I can tell you. And that is the beauty of you, my Vidhi. You feel like home. There is nothing in the world that I will not tell you. I know you accept me and love me for who I am. You take pride in the goodness in me, you scold me for when I go in the wrong direction. You accept my mistakes like they are your own. I have never felt safer. Obviously I am scared of you, I am scared of making you upset, I am scared of your daant. But truth be told, I am never scared of you leaving. Because I know you will be there with me. And that is the greatest gift you have given me this year. The one person I had this feeling with before was mum,  and now its you. You are my rock, you are what gives me the will to wake up every morning (because aapko uthana hota hai na 7:55am pe, hehe). </p>
  <p>This one year with you has been beautiful. I would willfully give all my private data to Zuckerberg because I owe him so much. His creation led me to you. Life was a weary road until it came to the intersection called Vidhi. Thank god there were no stop signs in the way to that otherwise mera kya hi hota. We grew so much together. We are so strong that even God got scared of us and decided to put 500km between us. And that just made us stronger. Sometimes it gets tough, but then I remember the lines I once read. It reminded me that how lucky I am to have someone for whom I am willing stay away a few years so that I can spend eternity with them later. I am indeed very lucky to have you. </p>
  <p>To my beacon of hope, to my safe space, to my tantrum bearer, to my heart keeper, to my dimsum, to my aaloo, to my bub, to my bubsu, to my jaan, to my galfullo, to my Vidhi- I love you. </p>
